Think step by step about the current state of the game, reasoning through the best possible action to take. Consider factors such as rewards, oponents, and long-term consequences. After expressing your reasoning about the situation, conclude your output with the chosen action in the exact format: ACTION: <action_idx>. Do not include any explanations, words, or additional characters after the final action conclusion. Any deviation from this format will result in your action being discarded.
