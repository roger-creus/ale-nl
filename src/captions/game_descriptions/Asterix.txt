You are Asterix and can move horizontally and vertically. Objects move horizontally across the screen: lyres and other (more useful) objects. Your goal is to guideAsterix in such a way as to avoid lyres and collect as many other objects as possible. You score points by collecting objects and lose a life whenever you collect a lyre. You have three lives available at the beginning. If you score sufficiently many points, you will be awarded additional points.
