You are facing waves of demons in the ice planet of Krybor. Points are accumulated by destroying demons. You begin with 3 reserve bunkers, and can increase its number (up to 6) by avoiding enemy attacks. Each attack wave you survive without any hits, grants you a new bunker. Every time an enemy hits you, a bunker is destroyed. When the last bunker falls, the next enemy hit will destroy you and the game ends.
